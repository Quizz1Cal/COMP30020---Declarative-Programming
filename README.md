# COMP30020 - Declarative Programming

Testing functions for the COMP30020 projects. `test.py` is for Project 1, `testP2.py` is for Project 2.

### PLEASE NOTE
The programs were designed for Windows OS - I haven't the time nor expertise to configure for other OS, so if you have an idea of how to go about that, I along with the rest of the cohort would be highly appreciative.

Refer to the description in `testP2` for directory/program requirements.
